In the repository the bug resolutions can be found in their respective branches (bug 1 branch for the first bug and bug 2 branch for bugs 2 and 3 (there were some issues with intelliJ and swapping branches)
The commits in each will show the process of debugging in a stepwise manner and the completed results can be found merged back into master.

Documentation for the bug-logs including the System Tests to demonstrate buggy behaviour can be found in the .documentation/ directory in .odt format (word will handle it fine, its just the open source document format)
with bug 1 having its log and System Test in Bug-1-.odt etc
similiarly before and after screenshots can be found in the same directory with the name Bug-1-Before.png etc

The github repoistory is located at https://github.com/Neo-Eyes-Gameboy-Geek/ITC-205-Assignment-4 and is a public repository so viewing should not be an issue.

Throughly enjoyed this assessment, hope I went well

Kind Regards
